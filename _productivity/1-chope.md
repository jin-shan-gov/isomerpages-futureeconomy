### **‘CHOPE-ING’ A PLACE IN THE FUTURE ECONOMY**

Not too long ago, flights, hotels and movies could all be booked online, while places at restaurants had to be ‘choped’ through phone. Many restaurants were even using pen and paper to take reservations – a problem Chope aimed to solve, by providing restaurants and customers with a single efficient platform to both get and fill the seats they want. 

### **READY FOR TOMORROW’S CHALLENGES**

From 5 people and 9 restaurants at the beginning, to a team of over 150 people working with 3,000 restaurant partners across the world, Chope isn’t just growing; it’s constantly redeveloping itself to serve people better. Today, they’re focusing on providing customers with a way to discover and enjoy new dining experiences, and create their own food stories. 

### **TAKING ‘CHOPE’ TO THE REST OF THE WORLD**

Arriff, the founder of Chope, is convinced that solving dining problems in Southeast Asia is a billion-dollar industry. He views his company and the dining solutions they provide as being an integral part of that. With their strongly Singaporean identity and their plans of expansion, the phrase ‘Chope’ could soon be heard and understood around the world!

### **THEIR FUTURE ECONOMY STORY**

#### **EMBRACING INNOVATION:**
* To create new services, products and experiences, Chope adopts a hands-on approach by working alongside and interacting daily with both users and clients to gain insights into their wants and needs.
* The Ticktok queuing service was originally its own F&B startup that Chope acquired. By integrating its queuing service with Chope’s reservation system, they could offer customers a single, more efficient

#### **RAISING PRODUCTIVITY:**
* Taking operational practices from airlines and large enterprises and applying them at an SME level means Chope can offer its restaurant partners a variety of ways to function more productively.
* For instance, it introduced an auto-ping function that automates the process of confirming reservations, meaning there’s no need for restaurants to call customers one by one, saving them time and effort.

#### **PURSUING INTERNATIONALISATION:**
* Growing into the region meant adjusting from their Singapore-focused mindset to embrace cultural and behavioural differences around the world, and even between different cities.
* By using a variety of tools to monitor and track everything from how long people spent on their apps to which restaurants they visited, Chope was able to make data-driven decisions that shaped its business strategy.

#### **GETTING AHEAD WITH GRANTS & SCHEMES:**
* Their first round of funding came from the National Research Foundation's Tech Incubator Scheme, which also helped them hire their first few engineers and experiment with user acquisition.
* Chope has also tapped on the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) Scheme and received ad-hoc government assistance to upgrade their systems, benefiting their clients even more.
