The CFE has set up five subcommittees to review and make recommendations in the following key areas:

### **Future Corporate Capabilities and Innovation**

The sub-committee on Future Corporate Capabilities and Innovation will recommend strategies to enable companies and industry clusters to develop innovative capacities, and use technology as well as new business models and partnerships to create value.  It will examine these in relation to MNCs, LLEs, SMEs and Start-ups, and the interaction among them within and across industries.

Minister for Finance Mr Heng Swee Keat and Chairman of the Singapore Business Federation Mr Teo Siong Seng will will co-chair this sub-committee.
