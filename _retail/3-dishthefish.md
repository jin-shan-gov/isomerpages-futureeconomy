  <i>“To young aspiring entrepreneurs, I would like to tell you this – Entrepreneurship can feel like a lonely road at first, but don’t give up. Take calculated risks, and never fail to plan. Last but not least, always be thankful for the ones who have supported your dreams along the way.”</i> – Jeffrey Tan

### **FISHING FOR SUCCESS**

Having grown up around fish all his life, it was only natural that Jeffrey would want to get into something fishy! He watched his late father run a fish wholesale business and his elder brother set up his own fishmongering business. Jeffrey, however, sought to start his fish trade inspired by clean, sleek markets he saw overseas. He was compelled to change the misconception of wet markets being dirty and unhygienic and also wanted Singaporeans to enjoy good home-cooked food made with fresh fish through DishTheFish. Jeffrey even set up an online ordering system and made recipes easily accessible on his website. 

### **READY FOR TOMORROW’S CHALLENGES**

To cater to a new technology-savvy generation of consumers, Jeffrey decided to bring his fish business onto the e-commerce platform by adopting a cloud system. DishTheFish also utilises a unified digital system to support its traditional business model through a point-of-sale system, an accounting and online bookkeeping software and a human resource management software that is intertwined and makes it easier to track costs and revenue. 

### **KEEPING UP WITH DIGITALISATION**

DishTheFish makes use of smart technology to help understand customers’ preferences and make suitable recommendations. To reach out to the younger generation, the company got onto social media and have been churning out educational and engaging content about fish preparation. Additionally, with the help of the Innovation and Capability Voucher (ICV) Scheme from SPRING, they have been able to use technology to streamline backend operating systems, so they can focus on sourcing the freshest products and delivering the best customer service.
