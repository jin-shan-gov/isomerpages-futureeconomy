The CFE’s vision is for us to be the pioneers of the next generation. In the future economy, our people should have deep skills and be inspired to learn throughout their lives. Our businesses should be innovative and nimble. Our city vibrant, connected to the world, and continually renewing itself, and our Government coordinated, inclusive and responsive.

Seven mutually-reinforcing strategies were identified to achieve this vision:

1. Deepen and diversify international connections
2. Acquire and utilise deep skills
3. Strengthen enterprise capabilities to innovate and scale up
4. Build strong digital capabilities
5. Develop a vibrant and connected city of opportunity
6. Develop and implement Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs)
7. Partner each other to enable innovation and growth

### **Deepen and diversify international connections**

The strategic imperative for free and open markets remains important. Given the current sentiments against globalisation, we must not only resist protectionism but forge ahead to deepen linkages with our overseas partners and seize opportunities in new markets.

The CFE’s recommendations are as follows:

* We must **strengthen trade and investment cooperation** by continuing to work with like-minded partners to advance the liberalisation of trade and investment, and reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers through platforms such as the ASEAN Economic Community and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Singapore’s joint projects to develop industrial and business parks in India, Indonesia, and Vietnam, as well as township projects in China, have delivered mutual benefits, and we should continue to explore similar opportunities beyond our shores.

* To **build new networks to facilitate innovation**, our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) and companies should link up with overseas partners in major innovation hubs and in key demand markets to form a Global Innovation Alliance (GIA). In-market partners can come on board the GIA to set up innovation launchpads, where Singapore and foreign startups can work together to tap on the expertise in our IHLs and their partners. In addition, the GIA can serve as welcome centres or focal points where Singapore-based enterprises and institutions can collaborate with overseas partners.

* We will need to **acquire deeper knowledge of regional and global markets**, by spending time in these countries. The SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative is one avenue to expose potential corporate leaders to quality overseas assignments. More internationalisation programmes can be developed for students to acquire Global-Asia market insights and immerse themselves in overseas markets, while trade associations and economic agencies should undertake more study trips so businesses can gain insights into the region.

### **2. Acquire and utilise deep skills**

With the rapid pace of technological development, our workers will need to develop deep skills to stay relevant. Learning throughout life needs to be our way of life, so we can quickly and easily adapt to new job demands, or even switch jobs or industries as the economy transforms.
