The Future Economy Council (FEC) drives the growth and transformation of Singaporeâ€™s economy for the future. Chaired by Minister for Finance Mr Heng Swee Keat, the Council comprises members from government, industry, unions, and educational and training institutions. The FEC will oversee the implementation of the recommendations put forth by the Committee on the Future Economy (CFE), and will build on the work of the earlier Council for Skills, Innovation and Productivity, which includes SkillsFuture initiatives and Industry Transformation Maps.
